## üìñ Key Learning Outcomes

After completing this series, you will be able to:

### Spring Actuator
- ‚úÖ Enable and configure Spring Boot Actuator
- ‚úÖ Access and interpret standard actuator endpoints
- ‚úÖ Create custom health indicators for application monitoring
- ‚úÖ Implement custom read-only and writable endpoints
- ‚úÖ Configure endpoint security and exposure
- ‚úÖ Monitor application health and performance
- ‚úÖ Integrate with monitoring and alerting systems

### Spring Transactions
- ‚úÖ Understand ACID properties and transaction concepts
- ‚úÖ Implement basic transaction management with `@Transactional`
- ‚úÖ Handle transaction rollbacks and exceptions
- ‚úÖ Use different transaction propagation behaviors
- ‚úÖ Configure transaction isolation levels
- ‚úÖ Implement complex transaction scenarios
- ‚úÖ Debug and troubleshoot transaction issues

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Use Cases

### Production Monitoring
- Application health monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- Custom business metrics
- Runtime configuration management
- Application state inspection

### Financial Applications
- Money transfer operations
- Account balance management
- Transaction logging and auditing
- Rollback mechanisms for failed operations

### E-commerce Systems
- Inventory management
- Order processing workflows
- Payment processing
- Notification systems
- Partial failure handling

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Port conflicts**: Change `server.port` in `application.properties`
2. **Database connection**: Ensure H2 console is enabled
3. **Actuator endpoints not visible**: Check `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include`
4. **Transaction rollbacks**: Verify exception types and rollback rules

### Debug Tips
- Enable SQL logging: `spring.jpa.show-sql=true`
- Use H2 console for database inspection
- Check actuator health endpoint for system status
- Monitor application logs for transaction details
